# M.Sc.-Thesis-plots
The repository contains plots from my masterâ€™s thesis and the code used to generate them.

In the "MATLAB plots" folder, each sub-folder contains the code and necessary data for generating the plots in the corresponding section. You can run the code all at once to produce all plots, or you can run it section by section to generate each plot step-by-step. The sections are organized in the same order as they appear in the thesis.

The "Other plots" folder contains the non-MATLAB-generated plots also included in the thesis.
