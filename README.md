# M.Sc.-Thesis-plots
Plots in the master's thesis and the code that generates them.

In the "MATLAB plots" folder, each sub-folder has the code and the required data to generate the plots in the corresponding section. You can run the code as a whole that produces the plots in one shot. Or you can run it section by section generating the plot step by step.

The "Other plots" folder contains the plots not generated by MATLAB but also included in the thesis.
